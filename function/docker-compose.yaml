# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

  # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
  # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
  # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
  # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
  # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
  # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
